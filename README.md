## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

In /server, you can run

### `npm start`

This spins up the DB server for the application.
Note: Will probably make a script to spin up both the server and client on one go

## IMPORTANT
In /server please ensure you have a .env file with the uri for the appropriate db saved as: MOVIE_DB_URI
